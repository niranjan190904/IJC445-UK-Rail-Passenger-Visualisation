# IJC445 Data Visualisation – Passenger Journeys by Operator

This project analyses passenger journey trends across major UK rail operators using official Office of Rail and Road (ORR) data (Table 1223).

A composite visualisation was developed to:
- Examine long-term trends in total passenger journeys
- Compare operator-level trends over time
- Rank major operators in the most recent year
- Assess changes in passenger journeys before and after COVID-19

All data processing and visualisations were created using R and ggplot2.
